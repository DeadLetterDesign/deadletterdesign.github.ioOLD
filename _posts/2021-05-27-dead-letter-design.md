Trying to pull together a website for my little-c cloud consultancy.

I've always found it challenging to 'focus' on one thing, one area of study or one medium to get my message across.

One of the appealing things about cloud though, at least for me, is it has these concepts that you absolutely fall in love with.

I have a background in philosophy, and weirdly enough I've come complete circle, teaching this stuff at a college where distributed systems still technically fall under philosophy.

But returning to concepts... the *dead letter queue* is the [dance macabre](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/danse-macabre-david-pumpkins-art-history) of information systems.

Messages that are being passed along than never quite end up in their destination, never get processed correctly or expand the parameters of what the system was designed for.

So it's one of the few terms that my eyes light up while explaining - I'll try to talk about it at more length at some point, and discuss the others at some point.
